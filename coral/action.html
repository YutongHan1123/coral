  </div>

<div class="main-text">
  <p><a href="../coral/threat.html">Localized threats</a> to coral reefs can be mitigated by local action.</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li><span class="strong">Manage Watersheds</span>: Clean water starts with clean practices on land. To prevent eutrophication, algal blooms, sedimentation, and chemical pollution, water quality must be managed at the local watershed level.This can be achieved by limiting the use of fertilizers, preventing deforestation, and reducing liquid and solid waste.
    <p>Local storm and wastewater management is also critical; filtration systems should be effective and make use of natural processes as much as possible, e.g., bioswales and deep-well injection filtration systems. Individuals can help reduce stormwater run-off by installing water catchments or rain gardens in their own property.</p>
  </li>
  <br>

  <li><span class="strong">Prevent Overfishing</span>: Being thoughtful about the source of your seafood can help prevent overfishing of reef fish. To learn more about what species are sustainably harvested in your area, go to Fishwatch.gov.
    <p>Additionally, overfishing can be mitigated by the expansion of <strong>marine protected areas (MPAs)</strong> that limit destructive extractive practices, i.e., certain types of fishing, boating, and recreation practices. The most effective MPAs are those that limit fishing and human disturbance. A well-managed MPA can be a boon to fish stocks despite limiting areas of access to fishermen.</p>
  </li>
  <br>

  <li><span class="strong">Support Sustainable Coastal Development</span>: Over-development of coastal areas has caused many reef-adjacent cities to be classified as “coastal hotspots”. By making your voice heard in opposition to projects that threaten nearby coral reefs and supporting coastal managers who are ecological-minded, environmental oversight can be strengthened. </li>
  <br>
  <br>

  <li><span class="strong">Reduce / Eliminate Single-Use Plastic</span>: Single-use plastics frequently make their way into the ocean where they eventually break apart into small particles called <strong>microplastics</strong>.
    <p>These microplastics can accumulate toxic chemicals and make their way into the tissues of living organisms, including corals. You can drastically reduce your single-use plastic consumption by making a few small changes in your habits.</p>
    <p>Commit to choosing reusable items like water bottles, shopping bags, utensils and straws, and opt for natural materials over plastic. When you absolutely cannot reduce your plastic consumption or you cannot reuse items, be sure to properly recycle all plastics and dispose of other synthetic waste.</p>
    <p>To go above and beyond these actions, consider volunteering at beach cleanups to prevent plastic from ending up in the waterways, and eventually in the ocean.</p>
  </li>
  <br>

  <li><span class="strong">Engage in responsible boating / recreation</span>: Be a mindful coral champion when you are on the water. Use mooring buoys whenever possible to avoid anchoring on reefs and other critical marine habitats like seagrass beds.
    <p>If you must anchor, find patches of sand without seagrass or hardbottom organisms. When snorkeling or diving, be sure not to touch anything, even with gloves; encourage others to do the same. When fishing, be sure to recover any fishing line, polypropylene line, or traps when finished and dispose of all materials properly.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="center-title">
    <p class="center-title">Action for Global Change</p>
  </div>
  <p>Even if all local threats are minimized, coral reefs still face major stresses from <a href="../coral/threat.html#bleaching">climate-induced bleaching</a>, <a href="../coral/threat.html#acidification">ocean acidification</a>, and <a href="../coral/threat.html#storm">worsening storms</a>. These threats may still be mitigated by reducing <strong>carbon emissions</strong> in a number of ways.</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><span class="strong">Support alternative energy</span>: Burning of fossil fuels like coal, crude oil, and gas, produces carbon dioxide that directly contributes to ocean acidification and ocean warming.
      <p>By investing in alternative energy sources like solar and wind farms or properly managed nuclear energy, carbon emissions can be reduced and a new energy industry brought to the forefront.</p>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li><span class="strong">Bike, walk, or use public transportation</span>: Personal vehicles contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide. Consider walking or biking (or skateboarding or rollerblading!) to nearby destinations when possible, and use public transportation for destinations further away.</li>
    <br>
    <br>

    <li><span class="strong">Use electric / hybrid vehicles</span>: Did you know that electric vehicles have been around since the late 1800s? Technology has come a long way since then, and so have the capabilities of hybrid and electric cars.
      <p>If you absolutely must regularly use a personal vehicle, and you have the means, consider switching to one of these relatively carbon-clean alternatives when you make your next car purchase.
      </p>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li><span class="strong">Reduce / Eliminate meat consumption</span>: One of the major greenhouse gases responsible for warming is methane (CH4). Methane, which traps heat at 25 times the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2), is produced in large quantities by ruminant livestock such as cattle.
      <p>Switching to a plant-based diet can be an effective way to reduce demand for livestock and lower methane emissions. If an entirely plant-based diet is not an option for you, consider reducing consumption of meat; for example, try <strong>“Meatless Mondays”</strong> or consume red meat only on special occasions.</p>
      <p>Pro tip: while incorporating more plants into your diet, try to source locally at farmers markets, or grocery co-ops. Also check out the <a href="https://www.slowfood.com/">Slow Food Initiative</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li><span class="strong">Get involved</span>: Use your voice to advocate for a greener future. Consider joining the Citizen’s Climate Lobby, a non-partisan grassroots lobby that fights for reduced carbon emissions.
      <p>Use your vote to support political candidates and policies that push for a climate-friendly future, at local, state, and federal levels.
